# Mather – A Math-Based Puzzle Game

Mather is an educational math puzzle game inspired by Wordle, designed to improve students' math skills and make learning fun. Instead of guessing words, players guess math equations!

## How It Works

- **Green**: The number or operator is correct and in the correct position.  
- **Yellow**: The number or operator exists in the solution, but in a different position.  
- **Gray**: The number or operator does not exist in the solution.

Mather encourages logical thinking and sharpens mental arithmetic, making it a perfect game for students and math enthusiasts alike.

## Key Features

- Wordle-like gameplay with math equations.
- Engaging visual feedback (green, yellow, gray) to guide the player.
- Designed as an educational tool to improve math skills.
- Showcased at the **2024 4006 TÜBİTAK Science Fair** at Tofaş Fen Lisesi.
