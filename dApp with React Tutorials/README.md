# React dApp Development Series – Code Repository

Welcome to the repository containing the source code for my **3-part YouTube video series** on **Developing a Decentralized Application (dApp) using React**! 

## About the YouTube Series

In this series, I walk you through the process of building a decentralized application (dApp) from scratch, using modern web technologies:

1️⃣ Setting up the environment and project structure  
2️⃣ Connecting to a blockchain and integrating Web3 libraries  
3️⃣ Building the frontend with React and deploying the dApp  

**Watch the full series on YouTube:**

##  Key Technologies

- **React.js**: Frontend framework for building the dApp interface.
- **Web3.js / Ethers.js**: Library to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Solidity** (if smart contracts are part of the project): For writing and deploying smart contracts.
- **HTML/CSS**: Structuring and styling the app’s frontend.
- **Node.js / npm**: Package management and development workflow.
